1) Why do we need smoothing? 
We need smoothing to remove noise from the data and make it easier to detect the important trends and patterns.

2) How does the window size affect the result?
The window size determines the sensitivity to changes in the data. When the window size is larger,
the noise decreases as a result of the lower variance in the larger window. However, a too large
window size could make us lose important details.
A small window size therefore is more susceptible to changes in the data and therefore removes less noise.
We need to find an appropriate window size for the data that we are working with.
